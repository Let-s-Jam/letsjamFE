Lets Jam is a community building web application that allows musicians or aspiring musicans to find other like minded musicians to jam with. A user can search for local Jammers in their area by name, instrument, genre, or distance. A user can also send other users "Jam Requests" in hopes to connect with them. A user can also edit their profile with the options of changing their instruments, genres, names or about me. Lastly, a user can view all of their connected friends in hopes to continue jamming with them in the future. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
