//we wil then iterate thru that array for every single one that has a value, add it to the end plus an ampersand
//we need a conditional to check if it's just one thing long it doesnt need the ampersand

//use a service to inject into the component
//service encapsulates any communication w the server
//could do a single service with everything in it, or multiple services if you're using different endpoints

//iterate thru array in the function that gathers values from the form
//for each of those, add a ${&instrument=${guitar}}

//store in an object so it has keys and values
// take those key and value pairs and create an array which we iterate thru

//multiple variables, instrument variable genre variable disyance wvariable and ame variable,
//we can add those variables into an array, for each thing if there is a value add it to the end of the string which becomes the uri



// getting the value from the form genre:${genreformvalue}
// conditional logic to see if each genre/instrument/etc. needs to be included because is has info
